    <h1>Privacy Policy – The Ear of the Closer GPT</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last Updated: February 2026</div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Ear of the Closer (“the GPT”) is an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to help users
        respond to sales objections and close conversations more effectively. This GPT operates entirely
        within the ChatGPT platform and does not independently collect, store, or process personal data
        outside of what is provided during an active session.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Users May Provide</h2>
    <p>
        When using the GPT, users may voluntarily input information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sales objections or statements from prospects</li>
        <li>Hypothetical or real sales scenarios</li>
        <li>Non-sensitive business or financial discussion details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Users should not enter sensitive personal information, including but not limited to Social Security
        numbers, full financial account numbers, medical records, or login credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>
        All information entered is used solely to generate real-time objection rebuttals and closing
        language within the current conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The GPT does not save conversation data, build user profiles, track individuals, or retain memory
        across sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
    <p>
        The Ear of the Closer GPT does not store or retain user data. Any data processing occurs transiently
        during the active session and is governed by OpenAI’s platform-level policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The GPT does not share user-provided information with third parties. All interactions remain within
        the ChatGPT environment and are subject to OpenAI’s privacy and security controls.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Training &amp; Model Improvement</h2>
    <p>
        User conversations are not used by this GPT for training or model improvement. Any platform-level
        data handling is governed solely by OpenAI’s privacy practices.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Financial &amp; Insurance Context Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        The GPT may generate language related to insurance, financial services, or estate planning
        conversations. All outputs are for educational and conversational support only and should not be
        considered legal, financial, or insurance advice.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, using generated
        responses ethically and appropriately, and avoiding the entry of sensitive or regulated personal
        data.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in functionality or compliance
        requirements. Continued use of the GPT constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
